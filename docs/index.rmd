### Starcraft

a recommended order to read the novels

1. *Heaven's Devils* and *Devils Due*, both good books that tell the story of Raynor and Tychus
2. *Uprising*, a short story telling how Kerrigan joined the Sons of Korhal
3. *Liberty's Crusade*, a retelling of the SC1 terran campaign (it's not a great book but a popular one)
4. *Speed of Darkness*, a retelling of the Battle of Mar Sara from the perspective of a group of marines
5. *StarCraft: Ghosts: Nova*, the beginning of Nova's story, takes place during the SC1 terran campaign
6. *Queen of Blades*, a retelling of the SC1 zerg campaign (much better book)
7. *Shadow of the Xel'Naga*, takes place between SC1 and BW (Seriously though THIS BOOK IS AWFUL AVOID IF POSSIBLE)
8. *I, Mengsk*, a retelling of the life of Arcturus Mengsk, but takes place right before BW as he recounts his life to Valerian
9. The Dark Templar Trilogy: Three books that take place after BW, personally my favorite starting point and builds up to SC2
10. *StarCraft Ghosts: Spectres*: The story of the canceled StarCraft Ghosts game, takes place before SC2
11. *Flashpoint*, takes place between Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm
